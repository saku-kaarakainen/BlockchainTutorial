# What is this project?
When learning a language, first thing you do is to translate the target language in your native language.
In my case my "native" language is C# with .NET Core Web API dialect, hence I'm "translating" the ideas of the tutorial into my "native" language

:)


# How to use this
I just started this, in order to learn blockchain technology, so there's not much here.

So far with this app, you can:
 - Build it (using Visual Studio)
 - It creates a single node, that doesn't connect other nodes yet.
   - Hence if you run it, it will be empty at first and the data will disappear once you shut the app down. 
 - Save transaction into a new block
 - Mine a block
 - Get the full chain with the saved transaction
