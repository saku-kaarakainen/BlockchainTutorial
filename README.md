# What is this project?
When learning a language, first thing you do is to translate the target language in your native language.
In my case my "native" language is C# with .NET Core Web API dialect, hence I'm "translating" the ideas of the tutorial into my "native" language

:)

I've hosted the app in azure, but it's poorly configured. API documentation can be found from:
https://blockchaintutorial-apim.azure-api.net/api/v1/swagger/index.html

But for example a correct endpoint is found at
https://blockchaintutorial-apim.azure-api.net/api/v1/api/v1/Chain
