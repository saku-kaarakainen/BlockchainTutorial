# What is this project?
When learning a language, first thing you do is to translate the target language in your native language.
In my case my "native" language is C# with .NET Core Web API dialect, hence I'm "translating" the ideas of the tutorial into my "native" language

:)

For  .NET project I've generated the documentation in the swaggerhub at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/saku-kaarakainen/BlockchainTutorial/v1#/.
