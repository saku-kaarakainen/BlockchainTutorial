# What is this project?
When learning a language, first thing you do is to translate the target language in your native language.
In my case my "native" language is C# with .NET Core Web API dialect, hence I'm "translating" the ideas of the tutorial into my "native" language

:)

I've hosted a node at azure, which i try to keep at the latest version, you can chekc it at: https://blockchaintutorial-apim.azure-api.net/swagger/index.html 


If it doesn't work, my credit card is maxed out
